		</div>
		<h3>Turning on Your Unit</h3>
			<ol><li><p>Turn on your GPS unit by pressing the button on the right side of the device labeled LIGHT. The device will automatically take you to the main menu.</p></li><img class="etrexImg" src="img/etrex10_setup_01.jpg" alt="Main Menu" title="Main Menu"></ol>
		<hr>
		<h3>Acquiring Satellites and Getting a Fix</h3>
			<ol>
			<li><p>The first thing you need to do with your GPS is get a GPS signal. Standing outside, scroll down to the Satellite menu and press down on your rocker / knob to select it.</p></li>			
			<ul><li><p>Make sure you are outside and in an area with minimal overhead cover (buildings, trees) if possible. The strength of your satellite connections depend on these two factors.</p></li></ul>
			<img class="etrexImg" src="img/etrex10_setup_02.jpg" alt="Satellite Menu Option" title="Satellite Menu Option">
			<li><p>Your GPS will need a few minutes to acquire / connect to satellites and get a GPS “fix”, a precise reading of where you are on Earth. This should take anywhere from 30 seconds to 5 minutes, depending on where you are and when the last time you booted up your GPS was.</p>
			<p>When your device stops saying “Acquiring Satellites” and instead shows bars along the bottom, you’ve acquired a fix. YOU CANNOT COLLECT DATA UNTIL THIS HAPPENS.</p></li>
			<p><b>A few notes:</b>
			<ul>
				<li><p>The bars at the bottom show the signal strength of the different satellites. The more high bars, the better.</p></li>
				<li><p>Look at the top portion of the screen to check the accuracy of the device. The box labeled GPS in the upper right-hand corner will show you how accurate the device is. If in an open area, leave the GPS unit still until the accuracy is <u>less than 30m</u> before taking a point.</p></li>
				<img class="etrexImg" src="img/etrex10_setup_03.jpg" alt="GPS Accuracy" title="GPS Accuracy">
				<li><p>If in an area with a large amount of buildings, leave the GPS device still until the accuracy is <u>less than 10m</u> (if at all possible) before taking a point. Try leaving the device on a flat surface if you have a hard time getting the accuracy to improve.</p></li>
				<li><p>More accurate points are always better. If you have the time, try to get the most accurate points possible, particularly in crowded settings where errors are costly. Please see the section on <a href="#datamanagement">Collecting and Managing Accurate Data</a> for recommended data collection methods.</p></li>

	    <h3>Averaging Waypoints</h3>
	    <p style="font-style:italic;">Averaged waypoints are much more accurate. You should always average the waypoints you collect.</p>
	    <ol>
	    	<li><p>Acquire satellites and a GPS Fix.</p></li>
	    	<li><p>Scroll to the WAYPOINT AVERAGING menu option. Press in on the knob to make your selection.</p></li>

	    	<li><p>The device will show you all of the points who have already taken. Since we are taking a new waypoint we will allow to the cursor to hover over the CREATE WAYPOINT option. Press the top of your cursor to make your selection.</p></li>
	    	<img class="etrexImg" src="img/etrex10_point_04.jpg" alt="Create Waypoint Option" title="Create Waypoint Option">
	    	<li><p>The device will begin to take a waypoint at your current location, and the sample confidence bar will show your progress. Once the sample confidence bar reads 100%, press in on the knob to Save your waypoint.</p></li>
	    	<img class="etrexImg" src="img/etrex10_point_05.jpg" alt="Sample Confidence Screen" title="Sample Confidence Screen">
	    	<li><p>A screen will then appear stating, “The waypoint has been updated.” Press in on the knob to complete the process of taking this waypoint. You have now taken one sample of your waypoint.</p><p><b>Important:</b> In order for the waypoint averaging process to be the most successful, the user should take at minimum 3 sample points.</p></li>
	    	<img class="etrexImg" src="img/etrex10_point_06.jpg" alt="Waypoint Updated Screen" title="Waypoint Updated Screen">
	    	<li><p>If accuracy is super important to you then you can take another sample.</p><p>Scroll down to the point you have just taken (in this case point 010) and press in on the knob to confirm your selection.</p></li>
	    	<img class="etrexImg" src="img/etrex10_point_07.jpg" alt="Select the Point" title="Select the Point">

	    </ol>
	    <hr>
	    <h3>The Waypoint Manager</h3>
	    <ul>
	    <li><p>The WAYPOINT MANAGER is feature that lists and describes all of the points you currently have stored on your GPS device. It allows you to scroll through your current points, make edits to the naming of your points and if necessary, delete waypoints.</p></li>
	  	<li><p>You can find the WAYPOINT MANAGER from the MAIN MENU.</p></li>	  	
	  	<li><p>Use the Map fuction in theWaypoint Manager to check that all of your points were taken correctly. If any of your points seem off, collect them again or mark them for recollection during your next field visit.</p></li>
	  	<li><p>Name any unnamed points in the Waypoint Manager while your memory is fresh. This will make your data management process MUCH easier down the road. Unnamed waypoints that aren’t noted or labeled elsewhere are often useless.</p></li>
	  	</ul>
	  	<hr>
	  	<h3>Labeling Waypoints</h3>
	  	<ol>
	  	<li><p>From the Main Menu scroll to the Waypoint Manager.</p></li>

	  	<li><p>Select the waypoint you want to label.</p></li>
	  	<li><p>The GPS device will take you to the labeling screen. This is where you describe the waypoint you are taking. Press the knob up to scroll to the top box, above the NOTE option.</p><p>Press in on the knob to take you to the on screen keyboard, which you can use to label the point. Enter a name describing the point of interest you are standing at.</p><p>This label is essential because it will tell you what your point is when you load it into the computer. If you are taking waypoints, you MUST label them.</p><p><b>Important:</b> Be sure to type your label into the title field next to the flag image. Entering the label into the "Note" field is incorrect.</p></li>
	  	<img class="etrexImg" src="img/etrex10_point_10.jpg" alt="Labeling Screen" title="Labeling Screen">
	  	<li><p>Scroll down to the Done option on the waypoint screen to label your point. Press in on the knob to finalize your point.</p></li>
	  	<li><p>Repeat this process after taking every point.</p></li>

	    	<p>What is the Difference between a track and a route?</p>	    	
	    	<p><b>Tracks</b> are gathered from data that is automatically gathered from you motion when the GPS is on. They provide a record of where you have been, so you can later determine your path and speed. Not all tracks have names, and it is difficult to determine particular points on a track. <b>Routes</b> are a sequence of waypoints. GPS devices tell you the distance and bearing (angular direction) to the next point on your route as you are navigating.</p>
	    </div>
	    <ol>
	    	<li><p>From the MAIN MENU screen, press the KNOB DOWN TWO times until you are hovering over the SETUP menu option. Press in on the knob to select it.</p></li>

	    <p style="font-style:italic;">Use the following techniques to outline and measure the area (square meterage) of project sites or areas</p>
	    <img class="etrexImg" src="img/etrex10_area_01.jpg" alt="Collecting Areas" title="Collecting Areas">
	    <h3>Option 1: Taking a Representative Point</h3>
	    	<ul>
			    <li><p>Sometimes you don’t need or can’t collect the exact outline of an area. In these instances a rough approximation may be enough. You should take a representative point and sketch an outline later.</p></li>
			    <li><p>Stand in the MIDDLE of the target area and take an averaged waypoint. Record the outline and approximate area of the area on a sheet of paper for later tracing in a GIS.</p></li>
			    <li><p>This technique is appropriate for areas of minor importance or extremely large areas that a surveyor can’t reasonably walk the perimeter of.</p></li>
			</ul>
	    <hr>
	    <h3>Option 2: Walking the Perimeter</h3>
		    <ul>
		    	<li><p>Sometimes you want a precise outline of an area for your maps. You can collect this two ways: turn on tracing and walk the perimeter, or collect points at every corner / angle of the area.</p></li>
		    	<li><p>To walk the perimeter, start a NEW track, obtain a sufficiently accurate GPS signal and then walk around the perimeter.</p></li>
		    </ul>
	    <hr>
	    <h3>Option 3: Collecting Corner Points</h3>
	    	<ul>
	    		<li><p>Alternately, you can collect an averaged waypoint at every corner of the area and estimate the area by drawing straight lines between the points.</p></li>

	    <h3>Data Guidelines</h3>
	    <ul>
	    <li><p>The manner in which you take points will determine whether your points are accurate and useful. <b>Consistency is absolutely crucial - always follow an agreed upon methodology.</b> Different surveyors using different data collections methods (where they stand, what accuracy is acceptable, how they label points) will result in a chaotic, useless dataset and a lot of wasted time.</p></li>
	    <li><p>Before any field data collection exercise, create a data guidelines sheet. This is a short, one-page sheet detailing the desired methods and GPS precision for each type of essential data you will be collecting. This helps ensure consistency amongst the field team.</p></li>
	    <li><p>Some example data guidelines:</p></li>
	    <div class="well sideNote">
	    	<p><b>Urban Area/ House/ Shelter:</b> Stand on the south side of building and wait for an accuracy of at least 5 m on your unit. If the south side is not available, stand on the east side of the building. If you can’t stand on the east side, stand on the north. You can use the COMPASS option on the MAIN MENU screen to see where you are standing.</p>
	    	<p><b>Field/ Open grassy area:</b> Collect a track while walking the perimeter of the point. Ensure that your GPS precision is &lt;30m at all times.</p>
	    	<p><b>Repair site:</b> If you are taking a waypoint a spot that requires maintenance that you hope to return to later, stand as close to the repair site as possible and wait for an accuracy at least 5 m.</p>
	    	<p><b>Water sources/ Wells:</b> Since water sources are generally further apart, take points standing next to the source with an accuracy of at least 30 m.</p>
	    	<br>
	    	<p><b>Important:</b> If you take a point with with a higher reading than 30m, your point will not show up in the proper location. In an urban or suburban area with clusters of buildings, points can easily be mistaken for nearby locations if not taken properly.</p>
	    </div>
		</ul>	    
	    <h3>Important Things to Keep in Mind</h3>
	    <ul>
	    	<li><p>BE CONSISTENT: Establish a standard and stick with it throughout the data collection exercise. If you are standing on the south side of a building in an urban area, make sure you are standing on the south side of every building when taking points. If the south is blocked and you have to stand elsewhere, establish a hierarchy of second, third, and fourth options.</p></li>
	    	<li><p>RECORD DETAILS: Make sure that for EVERY point you take you are naming and recording a description of that point in the GPS device so the points make sense when you upload them later.</p></li>
	    	<li><p>ALWAYS HAVE A BACKUP: If you are not able to record all of the detail for a point that you would like, or are having trouble with the device you should always have a paper form as a backup. The following spreadsheet is one example of the type of a backup recording method you can use:</p></li>

		<h3>Before GPS Data Collection</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Download all previously taken GPS points and tracks to your computer.</p></li>
			<li><p>Clear out all existing waypoints on the GPS devices and set your units (as described in <a href="#setup">Setup Your Units</a>).</p></li>
			<li><p>Ensure that all data is collected in the correct datum and projection.</p></li>
			<li>
				<p>Ensure that you have on hand:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><p>Extra batteries (Double AA).</p></li>
					<li><p>Paper copy of your data collection.</p></li>
					<li><p>GPS cord (if you plan on downloading points in the field).</p></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>During GPS Data Collection</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Give you GPS time to acquire satellites and get a fix when it first is turned on.</p></li>
			<li><p>Frequently check your track and point logs to make sure data is properly being saved in digital and paper form.</p></li>
			<li><p>Ensure all points taken are properly named.</p></li>			
		</ul>
		<h3>After GPS Data Collection</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Return and log in GPS devices.</p></li>
			<li><p>Download data from all GPS devices.</p></li>
			<li><p>Verify the data taken on the device matches the data on paper.</p></li>
			<li><p>Ensure that any data points that show error or missing data is re-collected.</p></li>
			<li><p>Send copies of digital and paper data to the managing institution.</p></li>
