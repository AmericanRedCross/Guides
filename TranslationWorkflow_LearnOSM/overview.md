Overview of Translation Workflow for LearnOSM.org
=================================================
[LearnOSM](http://learnosm.org/) provides easy to understand, step-by-step guides for you to get started with contributing to OpenStreetMap and using OpenStreetMap and using OpenStreetMap data. Although the site was originally written in English, volunteers have translated the various pages into several languages. These include [Bahasa Indonesia](http://learnosm.org/bi/), [Japanese](httP://learnosm.org/jp/), and others. This document is meant to provide an overview of the process for translating the pages into a new language.  

How It All Fits Together
------------------------
** coming soon: infographic explaining how the different agents and components interact and the flows amongst them (contributors, learnosm gh-pages repo, web users, forked repo, etc) **

Participant Roles
-----------------

1. __Githubber__
    - Requirements:
        - a moderate level of technical ability (e.g. using text editors to create/modify website content) or a serious desire and committment to learn
	    - learn how to use [GitHub](https://github.com/) and learn basic Git theory
	    - ability to troubleshoot and/or ask for help since even detailed documentation cannot cover every possible issue    
    - Responsibilities:
    	- initial setup of the new pages
	    - overseeing the work of the the translator and assisting with problems 
        - modifying some of the hidden elements of the translated pages for proper intergration into the main site
        - quality control and review
        - submit pull requests when ready to go live with translation updates    
        
2. __Translator__
    - Requirements:
	    - learn the basic syntax of Markdown, for composing readable plain text that can be formatted for the web by a program 
        - firm grasp of English and the target language
    	- learn the user-friendly interface of [Prose.io](http://prose.io)
    	- _note: it is easy for multiple people to work as translators because the content of learnOSM is divided among numerous different pages_
	- Responsibilities:
		- communicate with Githubber
    	- translate the English learnOSM pages into target language

Channels for Communication?
---------------------------
- Email learnosm@hotosm.org
- LearnOSM is official learning material of the [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team](http://hot.openstreetmap.org/) 
	- They have a [mailing list](http://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo/hot)
- The American Red Cross International Services Department is encouraging Red Cross Societies in countries around the globe to take advantage of open-source geospatial technologies for better project management and reporting
    - Having resouces such as learnOSM available to a wider audience is a great help
    - GIS staff may be able to provide some guidance and support ** (R Banick?) ** 

Unresolved Issues
-----------------

- A good method/SOP for tracking and incorporating incremental changes to content on the English version of the site that occur after the repo is forked for a translation
- Should there be a learnOSM mailing list?
