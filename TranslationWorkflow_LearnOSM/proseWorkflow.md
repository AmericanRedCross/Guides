Detailed Workflow for Translators
=================================

You want to help translate the information on LearnOSM into an additional language, that's great!

Setup a GitHub Account
-----------------------

- First thing you'll need to do is create a GitHub account 
- You don't need an upgraded plan, just the basic free account 
- Sign up and confirm your account
- You won't need to do anything else on the GitHub website

- Give your account name to the GitHubber on your team that will be managing the technical side of things
- They will add you as a collaborator to the translation project
- Once you are added, they should assign you a content page to translate

Navigating to LearnOSM Content Pages on Prose
---------------------------------------------

- You will do all your translating through a user-friendly, online, content editor 
- Go to [Prose.io](http://prose.io/) and click the 'Authorize on GitHub' button

- From the list of projects on the 'Explore Projects' page click on the 'learnosm' folder to open it
- If you don't see it, ask the GitHubber team member if they have added you as a collaborator

- After opening the 'learnosm' folder, open the '_posts' folder by clicking on it

- The folders on the page hold the different translations
	- 'bi' is Bahasa Indonesia 
    - 'en' is English
    - a [complete list](http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php) of language codes
- The GitHubber team member will let you know the code for your target language 
- Scroll down to find the folder for your language and open it by clicking on it

- The page will display all the core content pages of LearnOSM
- Scroll down to find the page assigned to you

Translating a LearnOSM Content Page on Prose
--------------------------------------------

- After you click on the '.md' file for a page it will open in the editor
- There are five navigation options along the right side of the screen
- You will only need to use 'Edit', 'Preview', and 'Save'

- If you click the question mark in a bubble icon, a help menu will open
- The help menu explains how to create various page elements in Markdown
	- the [wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is another good source of information
    - you can also practice using the side-by-side comparison on [http://markdown.pioul.fr/](http://markdown.pioul.fr/) (you don't have to worry about making mistakes, and you don't have to switch between 'Edit' and 'Preview' to see how your typing is interpreted for display)

- The 'Edit' page has shortcut icons along the top of the page content area 
- You may use the icons to add Markdown formatting
	- example: select a word then click the 'B' icon and it will add the two asterisks on either side of the word to make it display in bold font

- The 'Preview' page will show you how the Markdown is interpreted for display on a webpage
- Don't worry if images don't load

![](https://raw.github.com/AmericanRedCross/Guides/master/TranslationWorkflow_LearnOSM/img/prose_edit05.png)

- You should recognize various page elements from your review of Markdown
- The image below shows image elements
	- you should not change images or links when translating

- The image belows shows some a second-level heading and part of a bulleted list
	- Markdown is easy because the plain text formatting is similiar to the way the content is interpreted for display

- When you are ready to save your translation work click 'Save' at the bottom of the navigation panel on the right side of the screen
