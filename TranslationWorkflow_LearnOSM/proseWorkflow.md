Detailed Workflow for Translators
=================================

You want to help translate the information on LearnOSM into an additional language, that's great!

Setup a GitHub Account
-----------------------
- First thing you'll need to do is create a GitHub account. You don't need an upgraded plan, just the basic free account. Sign up and confirm your account. You won't need to do anything else on the GitHub website.

- Give your account name to the GitHubber on your team that will be managing the technical side of things. They will add you as a collaborator to the translation project. Once you are added, they should assign you a content page to translate.

Navigating to LearnOSM Content Pages on Prose
---------------------------------------------
- You will do all your translating through a user-friendly, online, content editor 
- Go to [Prose.io](http://prose.io/) and click the 'Authorize on GitHub' button
