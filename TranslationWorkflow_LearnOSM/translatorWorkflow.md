Detailed Workflow for Translators
=================================

You want to help translate the information on learnOSM into an additional language? That's awesome! You are helping make a great resource accessible to a much wider audience. You will be coordinating with a GitHubber team member who will do the more technical work. You need to learn a few, easy technical skills. The hardest required skill is translating from English into your local language and you are already an expert!

Setup a GitHub Account
-----------------------

- First thing you'll need to do is create a GitHub account 
- You don't need an upgraded plan, just the basic free account 
- Sign up and confirm your account
- You won't need to do anything else on the GitHub website

- Give your account name to the GitHubber on your team that will be managing the technical side of things
- They will add you as a collaborator to the translation project
- Once you are added, they should assign you a content page to translate

Learn the Basics of Markdown
----------------------------

- Using Markdown is an easy way to create content that is easily readable as plain text and that can be interpreted for better formatted display on a web page
- Read the 'Syntax examples' in the [wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
	- Pay attention to the Markdown syntax and don't worry about the equivalent HTML
    - Practice creating headings, paragraphs, lists, and emphasized text using [http://markdown.pioul.fr/](http://markdown.pioul.fr/) (the site will show you a side-by-side comparison of what you're typing and how it is interpreted for display on a website)
    - Understand what external links and images look like (the GitHubber will edit links and images as necessary but you shouldn't delete these parts of the pages while translating) 

Navigating to LearnOSM Content Pages on Prose
---------------------------------------------

- You will do all your translating through a user-friendly, online, content editor 
- Go to [Prose.io](http://prose.io/) and click the 'Authorize on GitHub' button

Translating a LearnOSM Content Page on Prose
--------------------------------------------

- After you click on the '.md' file for a page it will open in the editor
- There are five navigation options along the right side of the screen
- You will only need to use 'Edit', 'Preview', and 'Save'

![](https://raw.github.com/AmericanRedCross/Guides/master/TranslationWorkflow_LearnOSM/img/prose_edit02.png)

- If you click the question mark in a bubble icon, a help menu will open
- The help menu explains how to create various page elements in Markdown
	- Review the [wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)as needed
    - Remember that you can also practice using the side-by-side comparison on [http://markdown.pioul.fr/](http://markdown.pioul.fr/) (you don't have to worry about making mistakes, and you don't have to switch between 'Edit' and 'Preview' to see how your typing is interpreted for display)

![](https://raw.github.com/AmericanRedCross/Guides/master/TranslationWorkflow_LearnOSM/img/prose_edit03.png)

- The 'Edit' page has shortcut icons along the top of the page content area 
- You may use the icons to add Markdown formatting
	- Example: select a word then click the 'B' icon and it will add the two asterisks on either side of the word to make it display in bold font

![](https://raw.github.com/AmericanRedCross/Guides/master/TranslationWorkflow_LearnOSM/img/prose_edit04.png)

- The 'Preview' page will show you how the Markdown is interpreted for display on a webpage
	- Don't worry if images don't load

![](https://raw.github.com/AmericanRedCross/Guides/master/TranslationWorkflow_LearnOSM/img/prose_edit05.png)

- When scrolling through the content of a page you should recognize various page elements from your review of Markdown
- The image below shows image elements
	- You should not change images or links when translating

![](https://raw.github.com/AmericanRedCross/Guides/master/TranslationWorkflow_LearnOSM/img/prose_edit06.png)

- The image belows shows some a second-level heading and part of a bulleted list
	- Markdown is easy because the plain text formatting is similiar to the way the content is interpreted for display

![](https://raw.github.com/AmericanRedCross/Guides/master/TranslationWorkflow_LearnOSM/img/prose_edit07.png)

- When you are ready to save your translation work click 'Save' at the bottom of the navigation panel on the right side of the screen
	- You can change the message that describes your changes to be more detailed or you can leave it as the default
- Click 'Commit' and your changes will be uploaded
- Communicate with the GitHubber team member
	- Let them know about progress, delays, and any problems you encounter
